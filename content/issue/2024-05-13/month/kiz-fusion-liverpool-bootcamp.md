The 3rd edition of this Urban Kiz Bootcamp, starting with an hr focusing on the fundamentals and then an hour looking at combinations. They're promising to push people so maybe not suitable for your first foray into Kizomba but if you've done a few classes before this could be a great chance to level up.
