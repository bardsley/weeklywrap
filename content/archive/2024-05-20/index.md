Salsa events are definately like buses, sometimes crowded and you wait for ages and then 3 come along. This week we have nothing on Saturday but in a few weeks the 8th is the busiest day I've seen in ages. Don't forget if I miss something (and it's more than a week away) let me know.

You'll also notice I've started adding links to event where I can find them and I'm thinking about adding a little editorial piece at the top of the emails. After last weeks feedback (no-one suggested changes) I am going to assume this is a great idea unless you say otherwise.
