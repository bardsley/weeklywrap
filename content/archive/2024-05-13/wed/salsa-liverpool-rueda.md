Learn Rueda with Alex in a big circle. Rueda is a great way to learn Cuban style salsa with handy (sometimes) names for the moves. Rueda really is a great way to learn and looks great. This pure street version of the dance from Salsa Liverpool provides 2 hours of lessons with multiple classes to help you progress.
