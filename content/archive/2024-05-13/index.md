Week 2 of the wrap is here. Thanks to everyone who has liked, subscribed or shared. This week we have a couple of additions and the university class has finished until the students return. We're also adding a this month section for bigger events in the upcoming weeks. If you have feedback or ideas please do let us know, including how far we should get events from?
